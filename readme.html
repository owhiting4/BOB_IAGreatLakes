    <h4>ABOUT THE DATA</h4>

    <p>Our main data source is bur oak blight (BOB) survey data collected by the
      University of Iowa Department of Geographical and Sustainability Sciences.</p>

    <p>The study area spans approximately 500 sq. kilometers, encompassing several nature reserves
      in the Iowa Great Lakes area. This data was collected in the summers of 2022, 2023, and 2024
      by various undergraduate students. Each tree is recorded as a point with GPS coordinates
      collected using a Trimble DA2 and RTK corrections using a Trimble Catalyst GNSS subscription.
      Access to RTK services were not available in 2022, so that data has a lower locational accuracy
      than 2023 and 2024 data. In 2022, accuracy is within 4 meters on average while in 2023 and 2024
      locations have submeter accuracy. The data has been georeferenced to the NAD83 using the Universal
      Transverse Mercator projection in Zone 15N.</p>

    <h4>KNOWN LIMITATIONS</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>The same trees were not revisited every year, so in 2022 there were 390 trees surveyed, less
        than 80 in 2023, and only 99 in 2024. Because of this, it will likely make sense for us to focus
        our visualization primarily on 2022 data.</li>
      <li>Severity rating is somewhat dependent of the subjective opinion of the surveyor. While having
        a common scale for severity ratings helps, ultimately it is up to the surveyor and their eyesight
        to tell if trees have symptoms of blight (black or brown speckling, brown spotting, dying leaf veins,
        entirely dead leaves) and how significant those symptoms are.</li>
      <li>It is important to acknowledge that the scope of these surveys is limited to the work undergraduates
        were able to accomplish in a limited time window. There is a noticeable skew in the data toward infected
        trees because uninfected trees are difficult to find in the area and a limited sample size means that the
        this set of trees may not be representative of BOB in general.</li>
    </ul>
