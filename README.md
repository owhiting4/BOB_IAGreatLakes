# GEOG3540 Geovisualization Final Project: Bur Oak Blight in the Iowa Great Lakes

##This repository holds the final project for GEOG:3540 by Isaac Young, Olivia Whiting, and Tatum Long <br>

### ABOUT THE DATA
Our main data source is bur oak blight (BOB) survey data collected by the University of Iowa Department of Geographical and Sustainability Sciences. <br>
The study area spans approximately 500 sq. kilometers, encompassing several nature reserves in the Iowa Great Lakes area. This data was collected in the summers of 2022, 2023, and 2024 by various undergraduate students. Each tree is recorded as a point with GPS coordinates collected using a Trimble DA2 and RTK corrections using a Trimble Catalyst GNSS subscription. Access to RTK services were not available in 2022, so that data has a lower locational accuracy than 2023 and 2024 data. In 2022, accuracy is within 4 meters on average while in 2023 and 2024 locations have submeter accuracy. The data has been georeferenced to the NAD83 using the Universal Transverse Mercator projection in Zone 15N.
