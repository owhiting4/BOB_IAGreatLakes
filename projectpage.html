	  <h2>Details</h2>

	  <h4>Goals</h4>

	  <p>Our goal is to create a map with a compilation of our data spanning from 2022 - 2024 to represent the
      spread of disease within the Bur Oak species around The Iowa Great Lakes. We want to achieve this by mapping
      the spread and how it has changed over time using spatial and temporal data. To present our data we will create
      a series of maps to show how Bur Oak trees have been effected by disease spread and if the species is able to
      recover in the area surrounding the Iowa Great Lakes. We will compare maps to identify spread and recovery of
      trees and how well the ecosystem is doing in the area. To achieve this goal we will create a visual representation
      of effected Bur Oak Trees. Iowa's Bur Oak trees are susceptible to certain diseases and with worsening climate
      change the spread of disease worsens. Bur Oaks play an important role in ecosystems as they provide habitat to
      other living organisms along with keeping the ecosystem healthy and improving health of all trees. Trees thrive
      in groups as they live off and support one another. When they are being effected by disease it likely effects
      the whole area of trees. That is why this study is so important. It is key to map out affected trees so we can
      find solutions and fight to maintain healthy trees, which in turn, will maintain a healthy ecosystem.</p>

	  <h4>Data</h4>
	  <p>Our main data source is bur oak blight (BOB) survey data collected by the University of Iowa Department of Geographical
      and Sustainability Sciences. The study area includes an approximately 500 sq. kilometer area including Okoboji,
      the Iowa Great Lakes, Iowa Lakeside Laboratory, and several state parks and nature reserves. This data was collected i
      n the summers of 2022, 2023, and 2024 by various undergraduate students. Each tree is recorded as a point with GPS
      coordinates collected using a Trimble DA2 and RTK corrections using a Trimble Catalyst GNSS subscription. Access to
      RTK services were not available in 2022, so that data has a lower locational accuracy than 2023 and 2024 data. In 2022,
      accuracy is within 4 meters on average while in 2023 and 2024 locations have submeter accuracy. The data has been
      georeferenced to the NAD83 using the Universal Transverse Mercator projection in Zone 15N. Each tree had the following
      characteristics recorded in the field:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A lower canopy blight severity ranking from 0 to 3 (taken from Harrington & McNew, 2019)
        <ul>
          <li>If none of the canopy exhibits signs of blight, 0 is the proper score</li>
          <li>If up to 1/3 of the canopy exhibits signs of blight, 1 is the proper score</li>
          <li>If 1/3 to 2/3 of the canopy exhibits signs of blight, 2 is the proper score</li>
          <li>If greater than 2/3 of the canopy exhibits signs of blight, 3 is the proper score</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>An upper canopy blight severity ranking from 0 to 3, using the same rules as the lower canopy</li>
      <li>Combined canopy score from 0 to 6, by summing lower and upper canopy scores</li>
      <li>Diameter at breast height (DBH), the diameter of the tree trunk 4 1/2 feet off of the ground</li>
      <li>Tree height taken using a Nikon Forestry Pro II Laser Range Finder</li>
      <li>Photographs of the whole tree, undersides of leaves, and tops of leaves</li>
      <li>A brief, written description of the condition of the tree and its surroundings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One major limitation of this data set is that the same trees were not revisited every year, so in 2022 there were
      390 trees surveyed, less than 80 in 2023, and only 99 in 2024. Because of this, it will likely make sense for us
      to focus our visualization primarily on 2022 data. Another potential limitation is that severity rating is somewhat
      dependent of the subjective opinion of the surveyor. While having a common scale for severity ratings helps, ultimately
       it is up to the surveyor and their eyesight to tell if trees have symptoms of blight (black or brown speckling, brown
       spotting, dying leaf veins, entirely dead leaves) and how significant those symptoms are. Lastly, it is important to
       acknowledge that the scope of these surveys is limited to the work undergraduates were able to accomplish in a limited
       time window. There is a noticeable skew in the data toward infected trees because uninfected trees are difficult to
       find in the area and a limited sample size means that the this set of trees may not be representative of BOB in general.

      Potential supplemental data sources are satellite imagery provided by Planet Labs collected by the Planet Labs SuperDove
      array with 8 spectral bands (coastal blue, blue, green 1, green 2, yellow, red, red edge, and near infrared) and a three-meter
      spatial resolution. We also have a
      <a href="https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/esri::usa-detailed-water-bodies/explore?location=43.423508%2C-95.083775%2C12.63" target="_blank">
        detailed shapefile for inland lake outlines provided by ESRI</a>
        so we can represent the Iowa Great Lakes in our maps so users can spatially orient themselves.

    <p>These previous works lay a solid foundation for the concepts and principles that will inform our representation.</p>

	  <h4>Methods</h4>
	  <p>
      We will be using vector data to visualize effected Bur Oak Trees in the Iowa Great Lakes region. We will plot
      these points over a basemap of water bodies of the United States. From this basemap, we will clip the specific
      lakes we are working with. This will create a map of each lake that the Iowa Great Lakes consist of which include
      lake Big Spirit, Center Lake, and West Okoboji Lake. Here we can clip each clump of points that belong to each lake.
      By plotting points for each lake, the vector points will be more spread out and therefor easier to interpret and
      compare each year. We will also create colors for the points that match what the map is showing. Once the points
      have been separated to each lake, we will choose a different color for each set of points at each lake to visually
      identify differences between the lakes within each year. We will have a different color for each area. By doing this
      we believe it will simplify the data to where it can be easily interpretable while maintaining non bias within
      presenting the data. Our goal is for people to be able to interpret the disease spread among Bur Oak Trees in the
      Iowa Great Lakes region with ease while still gaining valuable information. This data presentation will hopefully
      provide knowledge of the threats that Bur Oak Trees may face and the need to help recover Bur Oak Trees from the
      possible effects of disease spread. It can inform not only people who live in the area and encourage action such as
      further studies but, also informs people outside of the region of the dangers and threats that trees and ecosystems
      face. We hope this data can help people form questions as to how they can help Bur Oaks and hopefully inspire further
      research into the issue.

      is a phenomenal interactive map that allows users to see risk levels for many tree diseases across the nation.
      BOB is listed as one of these diseases, but analysis tools for BOB seem limited. Regardless, risk visualization
      by watershed could be useful for our analyses and the metadata for the map layers should be further explored.
